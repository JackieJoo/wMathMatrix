  "description" : "Collection of functions for matrix math. MathMatrix introduces the class Matrix. Matrix is a multidimensional structure. A matrix of specific form could also be classified as a vector. MathMatrix heavily relly on MathVector, which introduces VectorAdapter. VectorAdapter is a reference, and it does not contain data but only refers to actual ( aka Long ) container of lined data.  Use MathMatrix for arithmetic operations with matrices, to triangulate, permutate or transform matrix, to get a specific or the general solution of a system of linear equations, to get LU, QR decomposition, for SVD or PCA. Matrix is a convenient and efficient data container, and you may use it to store huge an array of arrays or for matrix computation.",
